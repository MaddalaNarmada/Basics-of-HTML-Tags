# Basics-of-HTML-Tags
Here we are going to discuss the basic html tags which helps to build basic website


First we wil start the building of web page with the use of html and the first tag we are using are DOCTYPE,

Doctype means document type declaration, it informs the web browsers about the type and the version of html, helps the browser to handle and load it properly.

If we see the basic syntax of html page,
Here we go

<!Doctype html>    --> NOte: It is not case sensitive
<html>             -->opening tag
    <head>
        <title> </title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
    </html>       --> closing tag
    
    Note: YOU CAN USE ANY TEXT EDITOR FOR IMPLEMENTING THE CODE , EITHER YOU CAN CHOOSE NOTEPAD, SUBLIME TEXT ANYMORE.....
